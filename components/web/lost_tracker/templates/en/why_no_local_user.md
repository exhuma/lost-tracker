### Why must I log-in here?

You don't *have* to log-in. However, logging in gives you the possibility to
review all your bookings in one place, change booking details, and leave
comments on those bookings.

Apart from your e-mail address, we don't store anything in our database!

If you really don't want to log-in, you can send your reservation to
<reservation@lost.lu>!
